In his youth, Josiah was a medic for the military in a distant kingdom that was engaged in a drawn out conflict with another kingdom, but he never saw the frontline or any battles. His duty was to help with the clerics in preparing non-magical potions for light injuries in order that those with more magic than him could focus on the more serious injuries. After several years of seeing the wounded of what he considered a pointless, if not endless, war, he finally decided to abandon his post.

He traveled the expansive plains, mountains, and endless forests, surviving on the supplies he stole before he left and some food that he was able to forage along the way. After many months without seeing another soul, a fierce winter storm forced him to take shelter in a cave that he found. Severely exhausted from his wanderings in the storm, Josiah was barely able to unroll his bedroll before he passed out.

The next morning he awoke to see that the snowstorm had blocked the entrance to the cave. After his initial panic of being snowed in, he noticed that he could still see despite the lack of a fire. From deeper in the cave, strange wavering light and unnatural warmth emanated. With great reluctance, Josiah packed up his bedding and took up his sword and set off to find the source of this anomaly.

After about an hour of cautious walking, the light grown bright enough to see clearly and the warmth had become a quite noticeable heat since Josiah had worked up a sweat. After one last bend, the light had grown almost blinding, but before Josiah was an unwavering black shadow. The impossible shadow stretched from wall to wall and from ground to ceiling of the cave. There was no way to see beyond it, and yet this blackness was the source of the light.

Josiah stood in awe of this manifestation, the sword loose in his untrained hand. Waves of heat washed over him for what seemed like hours before he regained his senses. Tentatively he reached out with the broadsword to touch try to touch the shadow. The blade passed through the darkness without incident, so emboldened by this, Josiah stepped into the shadow, only to be enveloped by the black.

Instantly, a searing pain erupted from all over his body as though he had just walked through fire. Falling to his knees, he tried to breathe, but every ragged gasp only brought greater burning to his mouth and lungs. Dropping his sword, he doubled over in pain. He knew that this would be the place of his death. Looking up one final time, he saw before him a vast wasteland under the darkened sky of an eclipse, but then he was taken again by the pain. His screams only added to those of the other souls trapped here in this hell.

In the distance a lone figure that stands out against the demonic background moved slowly towards Josiah’s body.

Josiah awoke to the sun’s bright light shining into his eyes. Sitting up in a fright, he felt a horrible pain in his left shoulder. Looking at it, he saw that a pale blue ribbon had been wound around his shoulder like a bandage which he quickly unwound to find a nasty, red symbol branded into his skin. After rewrapping the ribbon, he realized not only that he was back in his bedroll in the mouth of the cave from the night before, but also that he could hear the songs of robins from the trees outside.

Confused, now more than ever, he hesitantly packed up his belongings. When Josiah went to grab his sword, he saw that it was gone, but had been replaced by a yew branch that had been fashioned into a quarterstaff. On the top of this staff, a different symbol had been carved—a perfect circle containing a curved line and an upturned crescent. Next to the staff, four flasks stood with matching symbols marked on their stoppers. Taking the flasks and the staff, Josiah ventured cautiously out into the spring day to continue his travels which would eventually lead him to the Stolen Lands.

Each night before he went to sleep, he instinctively knew to take a sip of the potion contained in the flasks. Just as he arrived in Oleg’s trading post, he ran out of the potion, but strangely enough, he realized he knew how to brew another batch.


In Serenity: Quinnlea Ryan was raised by her father after her mother left them. Her father was an alcoholic former cargo pilot who would try to use Quinn as his "wingman." She enjoyed any time with her otherwise inattentive dad, so that sort of became her idea of quality time.

Quinn wanted to be just like her dad, of course. She learned to fly the same ship her father used to. Flying became her passion, and she took up all sorts of piloting, including racing land vehicles. She fell into the "wrong crowd," finding she was nearly unbeatable and could make a lot of money from racing. The gang that ran the races also ran a thriving kidnapping and human trafficking circle.

Quinn fell in with this gang, smuggling various things for them over the years. When she finally wanted out, the gang offered her a "final deal." She must kidnap a major politician's daughter for ransom; getting her out of atmo while the deal was made. She half-botched the kidnapping and was seen by some servants in the house before she made it out. She was mildly infamous by then for her many petty crimes, and easy to identify. She made it out of atmo with the girl and made the exchange to another ship, finishing her deal with the gang. When the gang met with the father to make the exchange, police were there and a firefight broke out, killing the girl in the crossfire. Since they could not trace the gang members who delivered the girl back to the head of the gang, the father targeted Quinn instead.

Quinn fled the planet and lived off of smuggling, stealing, and racing until she was discovered by the crew in the campaign. She wanted direction and purpose in her life beyond thieving and living day to day. Eventually she joined the brown coat resistance with her crew.


His parents died of a fever when he was 11, leaving him to live in the streets of Waterdeep on his own. A local gang took over his parents house forcing him out on the street. He managed to survive by picking pockets and stealing from local vendors. Eventually broke into the hovel of Draeken Malios, a once famous actor/bard/adventurer in a well known theater troupe who was now slowly drinking himself to death. Seeing potential in the boy, Draeken made a deal; he would teach the boy everything he knew; how to read, use a sword, play an instrument, and use costumes and misdirection in exchange for keeping him in the drink.

The arrangement suited Shifty, who would spend the morning "working" out on the streets, and return to the hovel in the afternoon for his lessons. This went on for five years, until one day Shifty returned to Draeken only to find him beaten to death and the hovel turned out. Some street thugs had heard who Draeken was and thought that he must have some valuables lying around so they broke into the place and worked him over pretty good trying to find out where he was hiding it. They didn't find anything, and Draeken didn't survive.

Shifty spent the next week hunting the thugs down and murdered each one. The first was killed when he pushed him off of the docks with an anchor tied around his foot. The second was dragged along the cobblestone streets of the city behind a horse drawn carriage. The last one, the ring leader was killed when he tried to flee the city. Shifty tracked him down, overpowered him, and then dropped him down the entrance of a shaft leading into the ruins of Undermountain with just a torch. He didn't last long, because Shifty could hear his screams after a few minutes, and the sounds of whatever monsters live down there gorging themselves on his flesh.

At the ripe age of 18, Shifty left Waterdeep to seek his fortune. Since then he has run afoul of almost every criminal organization on the Sword Coast, and prides himself on being Faerun's only "professional nuisance".

Raf had pulled the cloth tunic from of the raiders, and used it to clean his axe as he walked out of their camp. Whether it was the blood of the raider he took the tunic from, or the blood of one of his companions, Raf did not know. He found it hard to keep track of such things when the heat of battle took him. In any event, the raiders were dead, and he had scavenged through their goods, taking anything that could ensure his survival out in this blasted land. Raf did his best to provide for himself without the need for such interaction, but there were times that even the most experienced wanderer struggled to live in the heat of the desert. He checked the sun and continued through the desert on his way to Tyr.

“The strong survive; the weak die.”

His mother had taught him that when he was still very young. They had been lucky enough to be enslaved together, along with Raf’s father. His parents were thought to be excellent breeding stock, and were kept to hopefully create more worthy specimens such as Raf, who was taller and stronger than other Muls his age. His father fought in the gladiator pits, while he and his mother labored away in Tyr’s iron mines. His father was no champion, however, and before Raf watched the last of his lifeblood seep out onto the arena floor, his mother taught him the most important lesson of his young life.

“The strong survive; the weak die.”

With his father gone, Raf and his mother were then sold to many different slavers. His mother was used to populate the ranks of many a slave owner in Tyr. They were never owned by one master for too long; Raf’s mother would give birth to a child or two, and then they would be sold and moved to a new slaver. Other times she would not even bear child, but instead be used for company for the foreman and his crew before being sold again. Raf was always sent along as an example of her stock, as with age he grew tall and strong, and came to be handy with axe and pick, with spade and shovel.

With each new owner came a new tattoo, a new brand marking Raf as someone else’s property. He did not know how many years he had lived in the blistering heat of Athas, but by the time he reached the height of a man, he had been marked by 37 different slave masters; his mother had more marks than he could count. His most recent marking was a design running up his neck, across the right side of his face, and spreading onto his bald pate like a creeper vine searching out a source of moisture in the desert. This was the sign of the slaver Irikat, and his would be the last mark that Raf would take.

Raf and his mother had been owned by Irikat for a number of moons by the time she was given to the foreman. She had been matched with three of his best Mul workers, and all three of them had produced shriveled, still babies delivered far too early for their time. Irikat deemed that Raf’s mother was no longer of any worth to him as a breeder. He gave her to his foreman Gaffon and his men to do with as they pleased. Gaffon was a brute of a man, and many thought that if he wasn’t a half-giant himself, he certainly had it in his lineage. A thick white scar ran across his chest, and it continued up and through the socket where his left eye used to be. He was a brutal man, and when Raf’s mother refused to take him as a lover, he found enjoyment from her in other ways. What was left, he fed to his dogs.

“The strong survive; the weak die.”

Raf did not shed any tears for his mother, for such was the life of a slave on Athas. However, he never forgot Irikat or Gaffon, or the screams his mother made before Gaffon finally tore out her throat.

With her gone, Irikat had no need to keep Raf as an example of her breeding line. He was quickly sold to another slaver, but instead of working in the mines as he had done all his life, Raf was to become a fighter in the pits. He had fought before, either in clashes with other slaves, or defending his master’s property from bandit raids. He had some skill with an axe, but he knew that the experienced fighters in the pits would likely quickly turn him into just another pile of meat, as they had his father long ago.

So, Raf and a number of other slaves that were destined for the pits were rounded up and placed into cages for the caravan to their new master. Gaffon sent a few of his best men, as a trip delivering slaves to the pits meant a chance to revel in the bloodshed, and mayhap make a few coins gambling on the matches yourself. They were also there to look after Gaffon’s son Jadik, who was nearing his manhood and wanted to see the gladiatorial battles for himself.

None of this was to come to pass, however, for one night when they made camp they were set upon by a band of raiders. Raf and the other slaves were quickly freed and provided arms, and instructed to defend the caravan with their lives as they had been expected to do previously. The raiders were particularly fierce, however, and many slaves and slavers both died at their hands. Raf lost himself in the carnage; soon it didn’t seem to matter at whom his axe was aimed, as long as it bit deep and found bone. During the fighting, he came upon Jadik hiding alone by the rear of the caravan. He smiled as he split Gaffon’s son in two in front of his men. It would not bring his mother peace, but it did serve to quench a desire smoldering deep in Raf’s soul.

As the battle began to turn and the raiders started to flee, Raf knew he too had to flee into the desert. Too many of Gaffon’s men still lived, and to stay meant certain death. The desert offered only a slightly better chance of survival, but it was one he had to take. His mother had taught him that the strong survive, and Raf was determined to be strong. At first, his strength was tested daily, even hourly by the perils of the desert. He had only stopped to scavenge the most basic of goods from a few of the dead raiders when he fled the caravan, so he had to work to find food, water, and shelter in the arid wastes. But over a period of many, many moons, Raf walked the earth, and as he did, the desert taught him how to be strong. He learned how to endure the heat, how to hunt the creatures that made that hell their home, and how to fend off parties of wildmen and raiders. His journey took him all throughout the Tablelands, and he visited many of the places where people attempted to carve out a life for themselves in that barren land.

It was at his last visit to a small village outside Balic that he heard the news from Tyr. King Kalak was dead and the new king had freed the slaves. Raf had figured that this might be a perfect time to pay a visit to old acquaintances. So he had started walking. If those he knew when he was still a slave had fled the city, so be it. He was sure there was coin to be had for him in Tyr.

For Raf was strong, and as he knew well, the strong survive.

And the weak?

Well, Raf had a pretty good idea about what he would do to the weak.


This young man is in his early twenties, sporting a short beard and grey eyes. A trace of a thin scar is evident on his left cheek. We is wearing green-dyed leather armor, black belt and high boots and has a short sword hung from his baldric.
“Tate” grew up near the village of Werth, not too far from the capitol. He’s fairly educated and came from a good family, although he’s had a taste for getting himself in over his head as a child. His Uncle Norhan told him stories of adventures and such, which got him “curious” about seeking fame and fortune.

When he was fifteen, he decided to explore the Blightwood Forest near his home, where he was grazed on his left cheek by a small bear. Since then he’s slowed down “a little” in his ways as part of the town militia, if there’s something exciting to do and he gets wind of it, he’ll definitely pitch in.

Now in his twenties, he’s a bit more respectful towards the wild. He doesn’t like being called Tatelyn, his given name – and is first to correct someone using it, except his parents. In his belt pouch, he carries a locket he found with a drawing of a rather attractive young girl and the word “Anna” in styled calligraphy.

Perhaps he can find out who she is, who knows.


Tarmasis, the black dragonborn, didn't know his parents, he was abandoned at birth, thrown in to the Underchasm. Somehow he survived the perilous terrain with no memories before the age of six, when he left his unforgiving nightmare of a dark and twisted home.

From what he can recall, his childhood was spent secluded in the plaguelands, hiding from hideous mutated creatures and forgotten pilgrims, occasionally finding the comfort of food and drink in the small city of Ormpetarr.

The years melted away as the dragonborn grew in power with his dedication to survive the horrid lands; all that were familiar to him. This natural tenant to explore places unfit for most people, lead him deep in to a soft glowing cave of blue light. Before him, illuminated by cerulean glow, yet hidden in shadow, an entity of unimaginable horror. Paralyzed by fear, he stared down the demon, the unknown depths of his mind tapping in to insanity with every lingering second...until darkness.

Tarmasis opened his eyes. Thundering flames soured past his vision, malevolent winged beings flocked over sharp red peaks on the horizon. He saw a landscape before him, as though he was flying. His vision near-impossible to focus on as his senses overcame with the horrid form of shrieking babble in his ears, impossible to comprehend. Deeper within the screams the sound of heavy chains chuckled like a torrent of rain upon his skull.

What felt like mere moments passed as he awoke once again in the cave, still touched upon by blue light, yet no sign of the demon. Only cold lonely stone walls remained. His head pounding with memories of his recent travels beyond. He held thoughts that were not his own, memories of countless lifetimes, thousands of voices from the past, now living inside of him. His eyes now shone a blue flame with a freshly cut spiraled scar upon his forehead.

Many years passed, with greater understanding of his visions. The ramblings clearer in translation, commanding him to retrieve lost relics and shrines to the Chained God, in aim to free him from his shackles.

Tarmasis can now be found lurking the most forgotten temples with his ever growing disciples, in aim to tear the very threads of existence asunder.

In his earlier years of life, Taonos was infatuated by the idea of becoming a powerful wizard. His life in the city was fairly easy-going, although not luxurious. His father, Albin Greywind, ran a moderately successful carpentry business in the city. Taonos and his younger brother Corthas always got along, running around the city with their other friends, enjoying life. At the age of 16, Taonos was accepted into the college of magic in the city where he lived. The Arch-Mage of the college, Grenendale, took a personal interest in him, believing him to be able to become his successor one day.

After about half a decade of learning the basics of wizardry and magic, Grenendale invited Taonos along on an expedition into an ancient temple that had recently been uncovered. The architecture of the temple was unique and who made it was unknown, but Grenendale had been doing research on an ancient civilization that he suspected once ruled in this region. The expedition revealed little about the ancient civilization, aside from an ancient tome bearing a mark that resembles a bone-like claw with three talons. Grenendale was secretive about the book, revealing almost no information about it to Taonos. For many more years, Taonos continued to learn under his master, becoming more and more proficient in the ways of magic. But, as the years passed, Grenendale became erratic and started to descend into madness.

One day, Taonos entered his master's office to check in on him, but found him hunched over the book with a crazed look on his face. Taonos tried to help his master, but Grenendale attacked him. After a short fight, Taonos had no choice but to vitally injure his master. As Grenendale was nearing death, he had a moment of clarity, grabbing Taonos and speaking only two words, "stop him". He then handed Taonos the tome and died. Taonos ran from the city, afraid that he was to be blamed for his master's murder. Taonos now travels the land, searching for answers about what happened to his master.

The book that Taonos bears calls to him in his mind, urging him to open it. Taonos has resisted thus far, but curiosity is starting to get the better of him.

Dorston grew up hearing the stories of his great-grandfather, a powerful warrior, capable of magic and incredible deeds, and his mighty, talking sword, Dawnshine. For some reason the family was nonetheless living in a humble village, with Dorston's father working as a smith, repairing pots and horse irons, sometimes the breastplate of a passing adventurer or expertly sharpening the swords of the roaming guards of the region.
Dorston didn't mind the quiet life, but the legends of his ancestor always tickled his mind. It comes to no surprise, then, that when he heard a clear voice in his head, while admiring the suit of armour and the scabbarded sword of his great-grandfather, he listened carefully.
The voice would tell him that it was none other than Dawnshine speaking to him, that the time had come once again for one of his lineage to take up arms against the forces of evil and corruption, all he had to do was accept the power Dawnshine could grant him, and free it from the scabbard it was sealed into.
Without thinking too much, Dorston did just that, and released the sword, which started floating in mid air in front of him. The pact was struck, the sword offered the young power, but not itself, flying away to an unknown location.

After that, Dorston started feeling strange, more and more every day, until the sword spoke again in his mind, and urged him to prepare for travel and adventure: a great destiny awaited him as its blessed vassal. And so it was that he departed his parent's home, with simple equipment and little training, and ventured in the large world, with the voice of a talking, blessed sword as his guide.

For several years now Dorston has been the willing servant of Dawnshine, and everything seems go pretty well for him, even though the shape and looks of some of the incredible powers he has obtained seems strange, he has no doubt, he is sure inside of him that he was destined to be this: a Paladin.

Unfortunately, nothing could be farther from the truth, as Dawnshine is nothing more than a ruse, a fake personality of an otherwise twisted and cursed entity residing the sword Dorston freed, and that is now using the young man to gather knowledge and regain strength, until such a time as he will no longer need him.


Kuligall was born into a nomadic orc clan that traveled the wilds of the north. From a young age, he always had an affinity with nature in general, and animals more specifically. The clans' resident druid took him under her wing after she found him talking with animals, and started teaching him what she knew.

But this life could not last for long.

A group of cultists that worshiped a primordial evil had poisoned the local water supply, causing all of the clan members to fall into an enchanted sleep... All that is, except for the druid and her apprentice, since they had some resistance to the posion.

The cultists came into the camp, gathering everyone they could find into a ritual circle that they carved out, and then they started chanting. A dark portal opened overhead as the druids watched, helpless to do a thing since the poison had the side effect of blocking off the flow of all magic. Tendrils of dark energies flowed out from the portal, tethering to all present, orc and cultist alike, with a larger tendril being attached to the young Kuligall.

As the life could be seen being drained from all present, The young half-orc could hear a deep, resonant voice echoing inside of his mind, telling him how it was going to take control of his body and bring a reign of terror down on the world like it had never known before.

At this moment, something snapped inside of the youngling, and he ripped the tendril asunder, not noticing as some squirmed into his forehead. All of this left him alone with his dead clansmen and enemies.He did not know, though, that the snapped tendril had left a portion of the old one in his mind, just waiting for the time that it could take over and be free...

Since then, he has traveled south from the frozen northlands that stretch further than the  furthest dale's, and has recently heard of a clan of goblins that have been ambushing people near Neverwinter, and has decided that he shall pay this clan a 'visit'...


Azalea was born in the Underdark to the sister of Zaknafein Do'Urden, Chandra Do'Urden. When Chandra was a little girl, her brother instilled in her the same ideals that were passed on to Drizzt, which Chandra then passed on to her daughter.

Azalea was trained in the art of assassination and spying from a young age, being sent to take out rival Dark elves and upstart duergar clan heads. In the process of these missions, she discovered a secret passage that led straight to the surface. She followed it up to the top, and there saw the surface world or the first time.

She found the grand expanse of sky to be exhilarating, and the trees were all new to her, as she wandered through the forest glade she had surfaced in. Reluctantly, she headed back into the deeps, promising to find that tunnel again. Several years later, when she was 17, she told her mother about the tunnel, which was when her mother revealed a shocking truth- She was not pure drow. Her father had been a slave that House Do'Urden had captured on a surface raid, and whom Chandra had fallen in love with.

Pulling out a small set of gear, Azalea's mother handed it over, along with a set of directions that would lead her daughter to a place of training. And, in doing so, Chandra gave her blessing for her daughter to leave for the surface, knowing full and well that it may cost them both their lives.

Azalea left, and quickly found herself at the tunnel. Once she exited, she breathed a breath of fresh air, only to discover that a band of orcs and goblins had taken over the glade. Quickly putting them to rest, the young rouge left, following the very same path her cousin before her had. Within a year, she had found the place of safety and training her father had mentioned, and now, 11 years later, she has set out for her first mission for a group know as The Harpers...

Petrichor, previously known by a different name, grew up in a large city under a powerful and wealthy family. He trained to be a wizard in his young years, excelling in potential even beyond his tutors, though this potential squandered through his fascination with a unknown entity that haunted his dreams.

This mysterious force became an obsession to him; it spoke whispers that had no face, it showed him horrific images that held no meaning.

In fascinated fear he ran from his city, his family and even his name; he became poor and unknown. In time, Petrichor was born from the ashes of his past, the dreams still as vivid as his youth yet their mysteries still withheld from him.

If there was one thing his lifetime of exiled searching brought him, it was the knowledge that the deeper he delved in to his alien nightmares the more powerful he became.

Found as a newborn near the foot of the nearby mountains by the human inhabitants of Hawk's Reach village (named for the red-wing hawks found in abundance in the surrounding area), Kriv grew up not knowing his family or his people. Due to the secluded locale of Hawk's Reach, Kriv is the lone Dragonborn anyone had seen in the area for decades. Nevertheless, the villagers decided to help him, and he was adopted and raised by the kindly schoolmaster Tav Windson and his wife Kera, even taking Tav's family name.

Owing his life to those who saved him, Kriv did everything he could to help out the village. From doing simple repairs to using his size and strength to protect against bandit raids, he became something of a jack-of-all-trades, and was well-liked in the community. Due to his upbringing with the schoolmaster, Kriv became well-educated, with an insatiable curiosity for the world around him and a love of exploration. Being so different from the other inhabitants, he also developed deep empathy for the outcast and downtrodden. Generally good-natured, with an endearing affability, he sometimes felt an overpowering loneliness, often roaming the countryside surrounding the village for hours, pondering his solitude among humans.

Kriv's innate magical abilities developed at an early age, and Tav encouraged their growth, as a way for Kriv to feel connected to his heritage. Aware how dangerous untrained magic can be, when Kriv was 5, Tav took him to meet the wizard Cailan Frostraven, who lives alone in a tower in the nearby mountains. Cailan, an eccentric hermit who cares more for his tomes than people, was nevertheless intrigued by the young Dragonborn, and agreed to mentor him, teaching him a handful of useful spells. Cailan believes that Kriv's abilities are tied to a medallion found with him as a baby, a crystal star embedded in a silver disc, with strange runes around the edge. In addition to helping hone his magical abilities, Cailan helped Kriv learn more about the Dragonborn race, though he doesn't have the foggiest notion how Kriv came to Hawk's Reach.

As he grew older, Kriv's desire to see the world and seek out his people became overwhelming. When he turned 16, he decided once and for all to leave Hawk's Edge and strike out on his own. The villagers were sad to see him leave, but understood his need to find his family.

Now 26, Kriv has spent the last ten years traveling the world. He tries to help those in need, and deals sternly (but fairly) with those who would harm others. He is not overly fond of physical combat, being more scrappy than skilled, and instead relies on his intelligence and magical abilities. He often prefers his solitude, especially during those bouts of loneliness that have followed him since he was a child, and he has never really felt at home anywhere. Preferring the open country to crowded cities, he is nevertheless adaptable to what is required in a given situation.

Kriv has encountered other Dragonborn, who pityingly call him "Clanless Kriv" due to his upbringing among humans. He has inquired about his past every chance he gets, but none of the Dragonborn he has met have recognized the medallion he carries. Still, he doesn't obsess over the mystery, believing fate will unfold as it will, and he never loses hope that he will one day find the answers he seeks. Instead, a curiosity of the world and a desire to learn drives him forward.


I am tired Grandfather, why have I been summoned,” the old man whined. “I have served the family for over three hundred years, but the life extending magics are exhausted, and I’m ready to die.”

The cold voice drifted across the ancient tower, “Three hundred years? Empires are laid low for the secrets that gave you those three hundred years, and yet you protest. Your family requires your services, and yet you protest. You disappoint me Archmage Terem yn Ujemi.” The creature, with a gesture, waved away the further titles.

The old man bowed his head in rebuke. “I am sorry for my insolence Grandfather, but my divinitions have revealed this to be the day of my death. I do not understand what I can do for you with so little time left.”

“Less than an hour to be precise.” If the mercurial creatures face held pity or compassion it did not show, though its gesture was one of paternal familiarity.

“I require one last obedience of you grandson of my grandson,” the lich said. “Candlekeep has turned away my agents. Olmur, the new Keeper of Tomes has decreed that seekers can stay no more than a ten day, and only the avowed now have direct access to the library. To fully preserve the revelations of Alaundo, he claims. I cannot abide being denied access. I need an agent in the library to conduct my research”.

“What of Candlekeep? Myth Drannor rises to greater heights everyday. Its libraries have long past eclipsed that of those odd monks and their chanting circles. I do not understand! I am to die today, how can I be of any further help to the family in this matter?” Terem asked.

"Mulhorand slain, Mystryl sacrificed, when even Gods fall what are the works of mortals. Narfell and Rauathar are ghostly echoes of the past. Calamities will come again and those that are high will be felled, those that are low will become ascendant. Cities that do not yet exist will have high kings not yet born. It is not the past you work toward, or even the present."

For a man at the end of his life, the past was all his mind could think of. His eyes followed the form of the creature his mother had brought him to almost two hundred ninety years ago, she had called him Grandfather also. He remembered the tears in her eyes, now long gone to the house of the dead. “For the family,” she had said leaving the crying youth behind.

Terem saw the lich pause on front of a table, on it was a book. The title read, “First Expedition to the Shadow Plane. Journal of Killium the Arcanist of Xinlenal”. Other objects the Archmage could easily identify as common in the enchantment of an item, other things, though his knowledge of magic was vast, were unfamiliar to him.

"Karsus's Folly cost me much," the once human creature said, his hollow voice ringing through the hall. "So much of my power was lost, it has taken years to recover. In truth, I have not and cannot ever return to the heights I once held. I have learned patience though, through my long years. It is a virtue you shall now have to learn as well."

"I am confused Grandfather. I do not," Terem started. As the lich turned he saw in its hand a ornate pendant, princely in its worth. Then he saw the Athame. "No Grandfather".

Archmage Terem felt his muscles seize, despite his considerable will and defences. The chants of the lich echoing in the workroom. He tried to focus on his years of arcane training and research, lost and forbidden knowledge he had gleaned from dusty and forgotten towers. All came to the same conclusion, there was nothing that could be done. The divinitions were correct, he would die this day.

"Less than a few moments left grandson".

It seemed to Terem that he almost heard regret in the empty voice. If it existed it did not stop the inexorable arc of the ceremonial blade or the brief pain that followed.

"I shall keep your phylactery with me, protected from all harm," the creature stated in between chants. He lifted the book and placed it on the corpse of the old mage. Skeletal fingers clutched the cover and opened it, holding it deathly still as it brought an ivory pen inscribed with runes, it nib filled with a golden ink gleaming with its own inner light.

With death, the cold fingers of fear had released Terem. It surprised him to find oblivion did not follow. He was still aware. Although blinded, knowledge of his surroundings still filled his senses. Throwing out this awareness he watched the creature he called Grandfather work with calm precision, tirelessly anointing the edges of each page with tiny runes.

"No Terem, there is no peace in death for either of us, we shall continue to protect our family. For you, Candlekeep will be your home, protect it well. In the years to come when your shade rises in its defence you will be looked upon as a guardian of the walled library. They will think nothing of your ghostly form roaming its halls. They will tell themselves you were once of the avowed. All while you obtain for me the knowledge that I need. The tomes that others bring will enhance my knowledge. If Candlekeep falls, mayhap you will end up in another useful library."

The spirit once known as the Archmage Terem continued to watch dispassionately as the lich he once called Grandfather patiently waited for the golden ink to dry and start again. It was over a hundred pages before the spirit realized the creature would press unduly hard on the nib pressing the ink deeply through the page. It took almost a thousand before the shade understood.

The inhuman thing that worked ever so patiently felt the spirits understanding, and was pleased. "Your phylactery holds your soul, while the book holds your spirit. As long as your soul is protected the book cannot be truly destroyed. It will always reform and call your spirit back. It is the only one of its kind, and Candlekeep will always desire you returned."

It continued to speak, uncharacteristically verbose, pleased with its own guile. "As long as you are in the library, I shall enter at my leisure. The monks will look at each page with care, the magics obvious even to a dullard. They will check each page carefully, first one side then the other, their study will be most thorough. The Avowed lack the wit to discern what I have hidden, for the magic circle I have created does not run along its pages, but through them. In as long as this hidden gate exists, with your awareness to draw me in, no ward now or in the future shall prevent my entry."

As the echo of his voice faded from the chamber the lich drew the final rune on the final page. The chant of many magics filled the air, some of the spells Terem recognised, non-detection, protection, and some he did not. As if to mark the end of his labors, the lich pressed his left skeletal hand onto the inside of the front cover, leaving a black claw print in the tome.

Finally, the lich called for his servants.

If the awareness that had been Syl-Vizer Terem yn Ujemi yn Sardikar el makhlab-dabab yi Memnon could be startled the sight of his former apprentice, a nephew,  entering would have done so. There had been no sense of time, but the boy he had left was now aged and bent.

"Grandfather," He said, his eyes wide with fear as he received his instructions and scurried out of the room.

House Talonmist traces their lineage back to the great diviner Sardikar Makhlb-dabab, descended from the Djinn, Imperial Dreamer of Calimshan and called the talon in the mist by his enemies now long dead. After being granted a vision foretelling of the Red Plague of -990 DR he fled north from Calimport with his family. Despite his attempt to save them, all except his youngest child perished in the plague. He railed against the arbitrary nature of the plague and his impotence in aiding his family. Sardikar became obsessed with the study of disease and death. He travelled the world with a singular purpose, he would defeat death and protect his lineage.

His obsession led him to seek a greater understanding of the dark arts and necromancy. Seeking to tease out the secrets of lichdom, as a means of forestalling his death; and by extension guiding and securing the legacy of his family.


Since then the he has shepherded the various branches around Faerûn, and watched from afar. For generations they bred and scattered across the Sword Coast and Western Heartlands. Acting as an unassuming family of merchants while slowly gathering magical lore and secrets. Tahlaunmiiz was the name his descendants bore in Westgate, Talonmist in Waterdeep. Though throughout the centuries, those descendants of both houses who showed an aptitude for the arcane mysteries would be sent off the family seat of "Kingsgrave Manor". Where they were to apprentice under the immutable patriarch, the lich Sardikar Makhlb-dabab, the talon in the mist.

In recent years the Talonmist family has been embroiled in a simmering feud with the Harpells, an upstart family of wizards from Longsaddle. Whom have disrupted Talonmist activities and acquisitions in the past. Members of the opposing families have even been known to engage in duels to the death when tensions boil over. The Talonmists also harbor a cold relationship with the Red Wizards, seeing the new expansion of the merchant-mages into the Sword Coast as a threat to the family business.

It is in this time, some 2,500 years after the exodus from Calimshan, that Modoc was born. The second of Jaheira and Ajantis Talonmist's three children, his early childhood was free of any significant turmoil or crisis. Modoc's parents made their living as spice merchants in the bustling port city of Waterdeep; and while they were not wealthy, they lived a comfortable lifestyle. This afforded their children the opportunity to receive an education. It was in this environment of learning and study that Modoc began to thrive. He read voraciously, sometimes late into the night and would often be gently scolded by his mother, for using to many candles when caught.

However, it would not be long before Modoc's education became a source of umbrage. The normally peaceful home would erupt with cantankerous argument. As the young savant challenged the teachings of his tutors, in subjects that encompassed everything from theological matters, to natual theories, and even the wonders of the higher mysteries. The study was often a room in the throws of raucous debate, in which Modoc's energy was spent disputing, correcting, and badgering his tutors. All the while demanding evidence of their teachings. Invariably these educators would resign amid a string of curses as they stormed from the family home. These resignations began to become a burden on the family finances, we well as a disruption to the education of their other children. Finding no other recourse for the dangerous intellect of their son the parents decided it was time. They sent a message, and received a response. Modoc was to be delivered to Kingsgrave Manor, where he would examined and tested; and if he was deemed worthy he would be formally apprenticed to the venerable "Grandfather Sar".

The precocious youth was sent east by carriage and arrived at an ancient fortified manor house set atop one of the rolling hills north of the town of Triel. The manor itself seemed to be built over many centuries. With evidence of several different construction phases and techniques, giving the structure an overall disjointed and bizarre appearance. Once admitted into the enigmatic building Modoc was questioned at length. Scrutinized by robed men and women of unclear relation to the boy though they bore a distinct resemblance to his father. Eventually he was taken to an antechamber deep in the vaults under the manor, the door to the room beyond was covered in luminous blue runes. At this point his robed guides instructed Modoc to "Wait here" before the pair turned and hurried from the crypt-like atmosphere of the vaults.

Several hours passed before the door swung open as if by some invisible force. It took Modoc a moment to summon to courage to enter. When he did the scene the greeted the boy nearly overwhelmed his senses. Smoke from burning incense hung in several gilded brazzers perfuming the air. A small library's worth of the tomes and scrolls sat in a massive, overstuffed, bookshelf and many more lay stacked on the floor and tables throughout the room. A number of crystals arcing electricity, hovered in place, occasionally shifted from one side of the room to the other.  In a corner sat a wooden table of polished ebony holding carefully arranged and straightened lengths of hair. Each set is tied together with bright blue string. The  sigil of house Talonmist covered much of the floor. The design is cut into the floor and its tiny channels are full of glistening mercury. In the center of the room stood the desiccated and mummified figure of Grandfather Sar. He was clothed in ivory colored robes trimmed with gold, his fingers and throat heavy with jewellery. Small crystalline stones floated above his head, atop which sat a circlet made of opalescent stone. The only thing that kept the boy from fleeing the chamber was sheer awe. As Grandfather Sar reached out a skeletal hand to gesture the youth forward he said "You need not fear me my child. But know this, your existence shall be that, which I weave for you out of sorrow and woe."

Initially Modoc split the majority of his days either assisting his master with alchemical experiments, deep in study, or carefully aiding with embalming rituals to fortify the liches deteriorating form. Though as the years progressed Modoc's apprenticeship became an affair of extremes. In one moment Grandfather Sar would patently guide the young mage through the intricacies of The Weave and spellcraft. The next the old lich would set impossible goals for any budding wizard to attain. And when Modoc would inevitably fail, his master was harsh and unforgiving. Evidence of the lich's cruelty was most evident at the end of his time at Kingsgrave Manor.

He was told by Grandfather Sar to prepared to a journey to the Shadowfell, no doubt so the lich could achieve some secret end. The process seemed simple; an aperture opened like a jaw, and swallowed them and they passed into another space. But something happened when the pair attempted to plane shift. And an error left Modoc separated from his master and alone in the Feywild.

At first he could only stare, open-mouthed, stunned at the resplendent natural beauty before him. But he was soon shocked out of this trance. The sound of his master's voice boomed inside of his head. "Return triumphant or die forgotten" the old lich said, and then it was silent.  By happenstance or destiny, Modoc had entered the Feywild in the territory of a Brass dragon named Parthanax. The dragon kept a keen eye on its domain and quickly "collected" the spellcaster as a sort of curio. Parthanax brought Modoc back to its lair, "The Grand Hall of Conversation" where it spent the majority of its time entertaining friends and visitors. The lair also contained an elegant foyer, a gallery for the artwork the dragon collected, sleeping chambers, of course a treasure vault that housed the dragon's horde. Pathanax loved to engage his guest in hours of long winded debate, and Modoc was no exception. This environment suited the young mage and he spent countless hours in deep conversation with the dragon and it's visitors. During his time in the Feywild, Modoc learned answers to questions his had not know to ask. After several months with the dragon he was able to convince Pathanax to send him back to the Material Plane.

He entered near Luskan and was quickly able to make his way to the city. Penniless and far from home, he initially tried to acquire the coin for the journey by taking the moniker Modoc the Magnificent and plying his trade as a street magician. Though it didn't take long to realize that more direct action was necessary. He hired on with a group of adventurers, the party consisted of Gorignak a goliath berserker, James the Younger a sly priest of Tymora, and Kamali a half-elf troubadour. They had been tasked with escorting an elderly priest South to Neverwinter, a city still recovering from the ravages of the Spellplague. The companions made good time on the road to Neverwinter, and delivered the abbot safe and sound to his temple in the city. The group spent little time in Neverwinter before heading South toward Waterdeep, where Modoc planed to part ways with his acquaintances and continue on to Kingsgrave Manor alone.

When the adventurers arrived in the village of Oakhurst, on the road south of Neverwinter, the villagers beseeched the party for their help. Kobolds had taken up residence in a nearby ravine, and had been stealing livestock from local farmers. With the promise of reward the party set out the clear the kobold lair. But in a strange turn of events, the minstrel Kamali, was able to negotiate a treaty with the villagers and the kobold matriarch Yidrasil. From there the group traveled on toward Waterdeep, but the adventurers would never make it. In a roadside inn they heard a rumor, a young dragon had ousted a group of dwarves from their mine near Mirabar. Anyone who could clear the mine stood to profit greatly. All Modoc had to hear was "dragon" to start making excuses to postpone his trip home and urge the group back north.

After a few weeks of travel the explorers had reached the mine of Khundakar and began preparations to plumb it's depths. The place was cavernous and seemed to descend for miles. When the group had finally reached the bottom, they found their quarry. A black dragon the size of an ettin. The beast fought ferociously but in the end, the creature fell to spellfire and force of arms. After gathering samples from the dragon, while the others gathered treasure. Modoc and the party set out for the mine's exit. Upon reaching the surface, the group encountered a single human male dressed in dark leather. The man introduced himself as Antony and stated he belonged to a group that specializes in the finding and acquisition of magic items known as the Black Hand. Impressed that the party had beaten him to the punch. He offered them a job on the spot, and with it an opportunity to join this network of shadowy archaeologists and tomb raiders.

Caught up in the excitement and promise of the whole affair, within days the friends and new employer were on a ship bound for Chult. Modoc was sure his master would overlook the delay when he returned with the arcane secrets gathered from such a mysterious land. They sailed into Refuge Bay, the coastal settlement of Ishau sank into sea during Spellplague and the city’s stone buildings lay submerged a few hundred yards off shore. The party disembarked on to the beach at the southeastern edge of the bay. On the shore sat a small fishing village constructed out of driftwood, palm fronds, and materials scavenged from the ruined city. Modoc and his companions entered the village and after offering gifts to the locals they were able to secure a guide. They stayed the night in a small driftwood hut offered by the chieftain. All except Modoc who was forced to sleep in the small rowboat they had brought ashore due to the villagers mistrust of magic. In the morning the party, except Modoc, received some parting gifts and blessings from the tribe before heading into the sweltering jungle.

By this time Antony had become the tacit leader of the group. He spent most of his time conferring with the guide, checking his map, and reassuring the adventurers they were on the right track. In contrast, Gorignak told tall tales of his many feats of strength and taphouse exploits to anyone who would listen. The minstrel Kamali was constantly plucking at his mandolin and tuning its strings while complaining about the humidity warping his instrument. All the while James whispered silent prayers to Tymora as his eyes darted about searching the foliage and undergrowth for any sign of danger. In total the journey took four day before the party finally caught sight of the temple of Tamoachan. This ancient shrine had lay forgotten for centuries and had only recently been located by the Black Hand. The massive limestone step pyramid that greeted them was engulfed by the vines and moss, looking like a fang pushing up through the jungle floor.

It was decided that Antony and the local guide would maintain a camp while the rest of the group entered and cleared the temple. They entered through a sinkhole that had opened up next to the structure and caused part of its foundation to collapse. Pushing through the lower levels they encountered a poisonous haze that hung in the air and sapped at their strength. They were further impeded hazardous traps and the denizens of the temple. Eventually the party reached the upper levels of the pyramid and the miasma faded. After entering the throne room of the temple they were faced with a long forgotten undead chieftain that had ruled over Tamoachan in years past. After defeating this threat the group was faced with one last obstacle.

An Oni occupied the highest level of the structure and stood between the party and the exit. The friends steeled themselves for battle against the demon. Gorignak charged forward striking at the Oni wildy with his massive gleaming axe. James moved to flank the creature where he could attack from the demon’s blind spot. Kamali and Modoc stood further away slinging spells at the beast. With a simple gesture from the Oni the entire chamber became freezing winds and driving snow, obscuring the party's vision. Before they could react the demon teleported between the two spell casters. Bringing down it's massive clawed hand down upon Modoc and with a single mighty blow sent the wizard flying across the room. Modoc's broken body slammed into the wall and fell to the floor. When the mage gathered enough strength to stand up and the stars cleared from his eyes he saw the Oni's claw clutching tightly Kamali’s lifeless body by the throat. Gorignak rushed frantically to cut down the fiend that had slain their friend. The barbarian’s progress was slowed by the freezing gales, but upon reaching the beast he landed many savage blows, splattering it's black blood throughout the room. A few meters away to Modoc’s right, James kneeled to steady himself as he fired arrow after arrow into the fray. Then, to the wizard's horror, he witnessed to fell creature’s clawed hand reach into Gorignak’s chest. And then retract with the barbarian’s in its grasp. The goliath managed to shrug off the wound just long enough to land one final blow before falling, almost cleaving the Oni’s head form it's body. With it's black blood spewing from many savage wounds the demon summoned it's dying strength. It raised a bloody hand and sent forth a deadly cone of freezing energy in a last attempt to kill the remaining intruders.

Only Modoc emerged from the temple. The mage struggled as he drug Kamali’s body into the green light of the Chultan jungle. The forms of his two other fallen friends floated upon a floating disk that followed a few meters behind the wizard.
